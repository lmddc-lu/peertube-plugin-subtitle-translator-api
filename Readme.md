# Subtitle Translator API

This is an API that uses a fork of the [Subtitles-Translator](https://github.com/TDHM/Subtitles-Translator) project to translate subtitles from one language to another.
It was made to work in pair with our Subtitle Translator Peertube plugin, which is a fork of the [Subtitles-Editor plugin for peertube](https://github.com/Herover/peertube-plugin-subtitle-editor)

All instructions to run & use the API are in the [Peertube-Plugin-Subtitles-Translator](https://github.com/lmddc-lu/peertube-plugin-subtitle-translator) repository.
